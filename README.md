Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors Assignment

5/8/2025
This is the Rock Paper Scissors Assignment for The Odin Project. I will use this ReadMe to layout the pseudocode for the project and attempt to keep it updated. So far this whole git thing remains a bit mysterious and i'm not doing a great job of keeping it updated. Will this change now? Only time will tell.

1. Create the .html and .js file and link the two
2. The computer chooses rock, paper or scissors (rps)
    will be a random number 1, 2 or 3 (1 = r, 2 = p, 3 = s)
    use if statements to turn number into rps
3. The human chooses rps
    turn rps into number 1, 2, or 3 (see above 2.)
4. The code compares the two
    if computer === r && human === p || computer === p && human === s || computer === s && human === r : human score +1 ? computer score +1 (???????)
    if computer = paper and human = scissors, 
5. Outputs who is the winner

This was difficult. I was stuck many times. I took breaks and things clicked around in my head and gave me ideas. I could not for the life of me figure out how to keep the prompt to keep prompting. I finally gave in and looked at other people's codes. I found a simple solution that worked for me. I feel okay about it, ha. This is quite the journey. I look forward to coming back to this in months and understanding it more. Party on.
